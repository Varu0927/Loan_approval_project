Case Study: Predicting Loan Default Risk Using MongoDB and Python
Problem Statement:
Financial institutions face significant risks due to loan defaults, impacting profitability and overall economic stability. The ability to predict loan defaults accurately enables banks and financial firms to make data-driven decisions in approving or rejecting loans, setting interest rates, and managing risk. This case study aims to build a predictive model that can forecast the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on their loan.
Objectives:
Data Ingestion & Storage:
Load and structure the provided loan dataset into MongoDB.
Design an appropriate schema for efficient querying and storage.
Data Processing & Exploration:
Extract key loan-related features (such as credit score, loan amount, interest rate, income, and loan duration).
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python to identify patterns, missing values, and trends.
Feature Engineering & Model Training:
Transform and clean the data for predictive modeling.
Apply machine learning techniques (such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests) to develop a predictive model for loan default risk.
Forecasting & Performance Evaluation:
Utilize time-series forecasting techniques to predict future loan defaults.
Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization & Reporting:
Generate insightful visualizations using Matplotlib/Seaborn to present findings.
Create interactive dashboards using Python libraries such as Plotly or Dash to monitor loan risk trends.
Natural Language Querying (NLQ) Implementation:
Implement NLQ features that allow users to query the loan dataset using plain English queries.
Enable MongoDB to interpret and process queries like: 
"Show me the top 10 loan defaulters with high loan amounts."
"What is the average credit score of borrowers who defaulted in the last 2 years?"
"Compare loan default rates across different income groups."
Integrate an NLP-based query processor to enhance user experience.
Expected Deliverables:
A well-structured MongoDB database containing the processed loan dataset.
Python scripts for data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training.
A report summarizing key insights from EDA and model performance.
Forecasting results showing projected loan default trends.
A presentation with recommendations for financial institutions based on the findings.
NLQ functionality allowing users to query and extract insights from the dataset easily.
